I used two different VMs to display the task one vm was running the elk stalk which will communicate with different host to gather logs.
The other vm was running a wordpress site and a filebeat containers which gathers the docker logs and forwardes the to elasticsearch. 
i have attached some screen shots of the working project in my repository.
the dk_host_elk_host image shows that i am running two different vms one mainly running the elastic 
stack and the otehr one running a application in this case a wordpress install with a mysql database.

the second image namely filebeat_logs shows the logs generated by filebeat this is here to show that succesful communication was taking place 
between filebeat and elasticsearch

the third image shows my running wordpress install
